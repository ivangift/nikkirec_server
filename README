Source code of NikkiRec (a.k.a the Grey Technology for Fantasy Ambassador)

I thought I've lost this piece after replacing my laptop. Fortunately AWS still
keeps my working volume even after I shut down the server (with a monthly cost,
of course). I don't intent to maintain this project any more. Since it use very
brute force appraoches, I decided to opensource it as well.
However, training data (screentshot of nikki's clothes) is subject to nikki's
copyright. I will not include them to avoid unnecessary troubles.

Most of the tricks are in Detect.java and Clothes.java:
Detect.java
 - Training data generation
 - Crop/Scale
 - Matching logic
 - debug information
 - Unit tests
Clothes.java
 - Similarity function

Prepare the data:
 - Use iPad to capture the clothes in freestyle mode
 - Scale (persisting ratio) to 800x600
 - Save as ID.jpg format where ID is the 3 (or 4) digit clothes id
 - Put into corresponding dressraw/, topsraw/ or bottomsraw/ folder
Generate training data
 - Uncomment the processSample() line in Detect.main() and run it
 - Code will generate dress/, tops/ and buttoms/ from the raw data
Start the server
 - Check tomcat manuals, NikkiRec.java is a http servlet that should be
   compatible with tomcat

Anyway, good luck.
